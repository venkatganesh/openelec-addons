These are my Openelec Addons - apache+php and mysql for now.

I needed a test web server always on that would run on my Rpi and be a media player at the same time. No xbmc distribution other than OE was able to handle my external harddisk spin-up/down properly so I decided to go with it, and because there was no LAMP addon for OE I decided to try to make one myself. I had much help from the OE forum, especially ultraman helped me a lot. I hope these addons will be useful to others too.

I also posted some binary builds for RPi, please see external links.
